🏗 Model Summary

Model: "sequential"

The table showing Layer (type), Output Shape, and Param # is the summary of your neural network:

Each row represents a layer of the network.

Output Shape indicates the shape of the data coming out of that layer.

Params shows the number of trainable parameters (weights and biases).

Total params at the bottom represents all parameters in the model.

📈 Training Metrics
Accuracy

The accuracy graph shows how well the model is learning to classify the images.

Ideally, accuracy should increase with epochs.

Loss

The loss graph shows the error the model is making.

Ideally, loss should decrease with epochs.

🎯 Final Results

Final Test Accuracy: 0.9050 (90.5%)

Excellent! 🤩 The model correctly recognizes 90% of unseen images.

Reference:

Simple models like this: 88–92%

More advanced CNN models: 93–95%

Final Test Loss: 0.2587

The lower the loss, the better. A value of 0.25 is very good for Fashion-MNIST.
